RAM is my favorite piece of computer hardware! The idea of random access memory was originally created by Alan Turing, who envisioned a theoretical machine that could have symbols writted on and read from an "infinite tape". I recently learned about Alan Turing in my Computer Engineering class. Also, my favorite unsigned binary 8-bit number is 00000110.
The idea of RAM is very intriguing to me. However, I know very little about the actual workings of RAM. Interesting, but confusing! 
Just started taking ECE 252, so I am going to know more and more as time goes by. By the end of this semester, I will learn enough to build my own RAM!
I took CS 252 last semester,learned a fair bit about RAM.


AND I took Cs 240 last semester and the only thing that got me through it was GUY FIERI. I PRAY TO HIM DAILY. follow him for more from flavor town


CS240 is difficult! Also, to wrap this up, my nickname is RAM, and that's why it's my favorite computer part :)
