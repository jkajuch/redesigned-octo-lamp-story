RAM is my favorite piece of computer hardware! The idea of random access memory was originally created by Alan Turing, who envisioned a theoretical machine that could have symbols writted on and read from an "infinite tape". I recently learned about Alan Turing in my Computer Engineering class. Also, my favorite unsigned binary 8-bit number is 00000110.
